# Intelligence-Sequence-Analysis

Introduces a novel computational model, "this project," designed to decipher numerical sequences using a streamlined selection of algorithms.
Initially tested on numerical series from IQ tests and later on AI evaluation sequences documented in literature.
Unlike machine learning techniques, which require substantial computational resources and face interpretability challenges, this project resolves such problems swiftly with conventional computing resources.
Showcases proficiency on the extensive numerical series in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) database.
Identifies patterns and predicts subsequent terms, highlighting its potential in addressing complex numerical representations and problems.
